# graphql-android
Repo where I'll upload my code according to my progress in the "Graph QL &amp; Apollo with Android" Udemy course.

## Techonologies
For the backend, I'll be using _Node_, _GraphQL.js_, _Express_, _MongoDB_ and _Apollo_. I'll also be using the and _Express-GraphQL.js_ middleware. The client will be a simple Android app.
