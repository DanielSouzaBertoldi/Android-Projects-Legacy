# THESE ARE LEGACY CODE. THEY DO NOT REPRESENT MY CURRENT KNOWLEDGE OF ANDROID DEVELOPMENT!
Instead of just making it private, I opted to leave it public because why the hell not. Most (if not all) projects were made following Udemy courses, which didn't teach Android best practices at all.

Anyways, I like to have a history of all apps I've created, so here it is.

If you do wanna check out more up-to-date apps that I've created that more accurately represent my expertise in Android and Kotlin in general, then check some of them in the pinned repositories in [my GitHub Profile!](https://github.com/DanielSouzaBertoldi)

## Android Projects

This is my personal repo. I'll be updating it while I create some apps in Android, both in Kotlin and Java.

All of these codes are just demonstrations of Android capabilities. They go from simple stuff like printing "Hello World!" to more advance stuff like how to deal with databases, background services and there's even apps that are clones of popular apps, like Uber. Feel free to check it all out if you want :)

### Installation

Clone this repo with ```git clone```, then move the project folder of your preference to your ```/AndroidStudioProjects/``` folder. Then, just open it with AndroidStudio or your preferred IDE for Android Development. Then just build the app!
